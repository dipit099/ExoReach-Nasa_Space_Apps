### Our Website : https://exoreach-e8718.web.app/

## Setup Rules:

### Please go to "config" folder under our "frontend" folder and find a file named "SERVER_URL.js" and set the value to "http://localhost:8000" for local running. Or you can keep it as it is. But make sure to wait for 50seconds to get the data from the online server initially because of free trial !

## Setup Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Setup Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
nodemon server
```

## Database:
```bash
Online hosted already . 
```

### You are good to go now. Happy coding!ðŸš€
