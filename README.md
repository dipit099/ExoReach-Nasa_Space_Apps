## But for faster response, you can run the project locally by following the below steps:

## Setup frontend:

## Please go to "config"" folder under our "frontend folder" and find a file named "SERVER_URL.js" and set the value to "http://localhost:8000" for local development. Or you can keep it as it is if you are facing any trouble .

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
nodemon server
